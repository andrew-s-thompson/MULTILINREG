# MULTILINREG
Multiple Linear Regression Optional Project for STAT 266

This Github repository stores one of my first solo data analysis style projects. 

STAT 266 was an applied introduction to statistics using R and RStudio to build these skills. While I have other projects in this course, this was one of my proudest projects, because rather than learning the material in class, I had the challenge of learning many new details about multiple linear regression outside of the course. Upon research to improve my ability to compose a cohesive analysis and project, I learned to understand, carry out, and interpret multiple linear regressions, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tables, F-tests, R, and other statistical analysis techniques regarding multiple linear regressions.

I aspire to a career where I can professionally utilize my statistical/data science skills in collecting data, describing data, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, approximating with distributions, inference for means and proportions, chi-square tests, and correlation/regression problems. 

This course was accompanied by other relevant courses in my schedule, such as a 400-level Special Topics in Machine Learning course, where I learned to utilize many other data prediction models. I also learned about other statistical and data science applications for technology outside of R, using Python, Jupyter, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Pandas, and  machine learning models. 

I am excited about future project opportunities and am willing to learn many different skill sets for those jobs. Cheers to the end of my freshman year and one of the many projects that I completed!
